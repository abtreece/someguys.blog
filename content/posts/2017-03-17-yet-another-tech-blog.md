title: Yet Another Tech Blog?!
date: 2017-03-17

Does the internet need another tech blog? No, probably not. However, I frequently lament doing a poor job documenting all the things I've figured out how to do over the years. Thus, I plan to make an effort to document those things here for all who find my methods sane to freely copy.<!--more-->

Also, while we're on the topic of this blog, an explanation of the "Some Guys Blog" branding. As a modern day systems administrator developer operations type person you have certainly referred to the blog postings and other documentation of random people you don't know. At a previous gig we used to joke that solutions to some of our toughest challenges were found on "some guys blog"... thus here we are.

I'm just a guy, with a blog, hoping to help you with some tech problem.
